Files for CIA Team Project / Inteview 2013

These are the current versions of the PHP files for my Tuesday meeting with your team. Please feel free to edit code or add comments.

Thanks for your time and look forward to speaking with you!

**Sun 5:32pm update**

  Still having difficulty with the Revision of records part of this assignment. It is possible I will have time to fix it     prior to the meeting.
  
  I am aware of the possibilty of SQL injection vulnerability in this code, and that it would not be deployed as written

**Sun 8:00pm update**

  I've worked on the revision solution and am about halfway there. I'm not sure if my work/family responsibilities are        going to let me have much more time before we speak on Tuesday, and in some ways I'd actually be curious as to the        solutions you experts suggest. I might update the project tomorrow evening if I have additional time. Thanks!
